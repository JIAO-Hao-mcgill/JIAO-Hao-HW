We can find from fig.\ref{6-1} that the `random numbers (vectors)' producted by C standard library are lying on some planes and they are very much not randomly distributed in 3D space. 

But I got more planes than professor: at least 35 horizontal plane (shown in ``6-1-7.png''), and there also are planes with other derection (three direction should be the same).

I didn't successfully run the library of python (``JIAO Hao-6-1-1''). But I think the ramdom number generated by python is good. I show 10000 and 100000 ramdom points generated by ``1e8*np.random.rand(n)'' in the same volume as above, and we can see that they are really random (``JIAO Hao-6-1-1'', and fig.\ref{6-1-2}).

\section{Problem 2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Which of Lorentzians, Gaussians, and power laws could you use for the bounding distribution?}

If the distribution is bounded in $[0,a]$, we can use all three distribution to get the exponential deviates. But if we consider the distribution at $[0,\infty]$, we can only use Lorentzians and power laws:
\bas
&\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\exp[x/\tau]}{\tau}/\frac{1}{\pi(1+x^2)}=0\\
&\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\exp[x/\tau]}{\tau}/\frac{\exp[-x^2/2\sigma^2]}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}=\infty\\
&\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\exp[x/\tau]}{\tau}/(\alpha+1)x^\alpha=0
\end{align*}

I use both Lorentzians and power laws:

Form Lorentzian:

\gray{The accept rate from Lorentz to Exponential deviates is 6365045 / 9366561 = 0.6795498369145303}

\gray{Transformation method use 0.22466683387756348 s.}

\gray{The rejection method use 1.4030277729034424 s.}~~~~

Form power laws:

\gray{The accept rate from PowerLaw to Exponential deviates is 7034369 / 9500645 = 0.7404096248202096}

\gray{Transformation method use 0.25522756576538086 s.}

\gray{The rejection method use 1.9982857704162598 s.}

~~~~

\textbf{The histogram of my deviates matches up with the expected exponential curve}

Shown in fig.\ref{6-2}. We can see that both the two distribution matched the expected exponential curve very well.

\textbf{How efficient can you make this generator, in terms of the fraction of uniform deviates that give rise to an exponential deviate?}

\gray{The accept rate from Lorentz to Exponential deviates is 6365045 / 9366561 = 0.6795498369145303}

\gray{The accept rate from PowerLaw to Exponential deviates is 7034369 / 9500645 = 0.7404096248202096}

\gray{The accept rate from Uniform to Exponential deviates is 1001223 / 10000000 = 0.1001223}

\section{Problem 3}

Since the random number with exponential distribution is alway positive, we shuold keep $v/u>0$ \RA $v\in [0,1]$ rather than $v\in[-1,1]$.

The result is shown in fig.\ref{6-3}. From this, we can see that this generator also produces the correct answer.

~~~~

And we can get that the efficiency of this genertor is acceptable:

\gray{The accept rate of ratio-of-uniforms generator is 0.5002858}
